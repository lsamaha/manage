# Leaders!

Have you ever wondered what it takes to be a manager in technology? This repository
will answer that question and more. It will transfer to you the management system
to which I owe my own global recognition as a leader!

### The System
*Leaders!* let's you be the manager you can be without all the hassle of 
training and experience required by other systems. I wasn't always a leader 
and neither were you. What changed all that is what I am about to share 
with you in the form of a management system that is as simple as it is complete.

### Communication Templates
These simple templates provide everything you need to communicate effectively 
as a mangemer to any audience in any situation.
#### #1: Feedback on an Expected Result 
> This is just the kind of < effort | garbage | genious | drama > I've come to expect from you.
#### #2: Team Feedback on an Expected Result 
> < Template #1 > people.
#### #3: Feedback on an Unexpected Result
> I don't think anyone here had a < crystal ball | better idea | clue > when 
< we | individual | the client > started all this. And if anyone did let me know! 
<wait for laughter | accept no laughter forthcoming >
At the end of the day < I | the team | individual | the client >
simply < fell short | betrayed us | broke down | were brilliant > 
and today I am < disappointed | proud > to tell you 
< I | he | she | they > < will be let go | deserve our gratitude >. 

### Money is the Answer
You may be thinking: 

> You have promised me a management solution and shown me nothing but jibberish.

Good. That is the manager in you coming out. As a manager it's unrealistic 
to expect you to understand the templating expressions used in the system. 

Rest assured, All of the tempaltes above are available for automated delivery to
any audience for any situation without an engineer. One low monthly ptice gives you
complete access to *the system* and its templates for use with your team.
